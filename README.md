This is the sudokusolver exercise.

In this exercise you'll have to implement an interface that solves sudokus.

The test case will call the solveSudoku() method with a 4x4 twodimensional array as the 'integers' parameter.
Example:

[2, null, null,    1,
 3,    1, null     4,
 1, null,    2, null,
 4,    2, null,    3]
 
The result of integers[0] will be the first row.
Consequently, the result of integers[0][3] will be 1.

Your implementation should return a same-sized twodimensional array with all the elements filled in correctly.
